# Python 101 : The global greeting

## 📝 Purpose of the Repository
In the IT industry, the "Hello World" script is a time-honored tradition. This repository serves as my **technical launchpad**, demonstrating the successful setup of a local development environment and its connection to a cloud-based version control system (GitHub). 

It highlights the transition from a local machine to a global platform, showcasing the workflow of a modern developer.

## 📄 What the Python Script Does
The script `hello.py` is a streamlined demonstration of Python’s output capabilities:
* **Function:** It utilizes the `print()` function to send a string of data to the system console.
* **Message:** It outputs a specific greeting: *"Hello! This is my first Python script on GitHub."*
* **Core Concept:** It proves that the Python interpreter is correctly configured and that the syntax is valid.

## 🔍 Example Output
When you run the script, the terminal will display:
> `Hello! This is my first Python script on GitHub.`
